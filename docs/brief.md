## Background
Our company is dedicated to revolutionizing elementary education by developing an innovative AI Tutor specifically designed to enhance learning experiences for young students. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, we aim to provide personalized and interactive educational support, catering to the unique needs of each child. Our AI Tutor will serve as a virtual companion, delivering engaging lessons, step-by-step explanations, and real-time feedback, ultimately fostering a love for learning and boosting academic success.


### Market
The education system in Israel consists of three tiers: primary education (grades 1–6, approximately ages 6–12), middle school (grades 7–9, approximately ages 12–15) and high school (grades 10–12, approximately ages 15–19). Our primary target market comprises children in primary education, resulting in a market size of over 800,000 in Israel alone. Furthermore, the cost of replicating this system in other countries is minimal. 


### 2. Customers
Cloud adoption is still growing, and the vast majority of enterprise organizations and more than 50% of SMBs spend more than [a million dollars](https://www.flexera.com/blog/cloud/cloud-computing-trends-2022-state-of-the-cloud-report/#:~:text=Public%20cloud%20continues%20to%20accelerate&text=Thirty%2Dseven%20percent%20of%20enterprises,exceeds%20%241.2%20million%20per%20year.) a year on cloud computing.

## Problem Statement

### 1. Waste
Companies struggle to use cloud resources efficiently. A third of cloud computing investments are being [wasted](https://techmonitor.ai/technology/cloud/cloud-spending-wasted-oracle-computing-aws-azure) according to the [Flexera](https://www.flexera.com/) survey of over 750 businesses.

### 2. A Visible Waste
The whole idea of Cloud is [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(cloud_computing)). Cloud will provide as many resources as one requests. Mistakes in resource sizing, scaling in/out, keeping idle resources will result an overspending. This problem is well known. A bunch of companies provide software for financial management of cloud resources.

### 3. An Invisible Waste
It is 'normal' for [Cloud Native Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_native_computing) to be suboptimal from performance point of view. Cloud Native Applications are designed for scalability and run on Cloud where resources are virtually unlimited. When a Cloud Native Application reaches 100% of CPU utilization on production it is easier to scale out resources than execute a hard and time-consuming performance optimization activities. Performance optimization is done only when the cloud cost skyrockets.

### 4. Need or Desire
[40 Billion](https://techmonitor.ai/technology/cloud/cloud-spending-wasted-oracle-computing-aws-azure) of US dollars that are wasted yearly, energy efficiency, reducing [carbon footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint) - all these are good reasons to invest in Cloud Cost Optimization tools.
