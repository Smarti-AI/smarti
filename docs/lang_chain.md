# LangChain Framework

## Background
We're familiar with ChatGPT's impressive general knowledgeâ€”it can answer a wide range of questions quite well. However, when it comes to specific domains, the answers may not meet our expectations. But what if we could connect LLM to proprietary data sources like organizational databases, PDF documents, books, or other repositories of domain-specific knowledge? This connection would empower LLM to access and utilize specialized information, resulting in better and more accurate responses within that specific domain. It's an exciting possibility that can enhance the performance of ChatGPT and provide tailored insights for specific topics.

At its essence, LangChain is a framework centered around LLMs (Language Models) that facilitates referencing external data sources without the need for copy-pasting them into the LLM's prompt. However, LangChain goes beyond that functionality. It empowers you to take action based on the obtained information, such as sending emails, updating databases, running scripts, and more. In essence, LangChain enables seamless integration between LLMs and external systems, enabling dynamic and automated workflows beyond mere data referencing.

We can use LangChain Framework to build chatbots, Generative Question-Answering (GQA), summarization, and much more. LangChain has built-in support for integrations with systems including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Azure cloud storage; API wrappers for news, movie information, and weather; Bash for summarization, syntax and semantics checking, and execution of shell scripts; multiple web scraping subsystems and templates; few-shot learning prompt generation support; finding and summarizing "todo" tasks in code; Google Drive documents, spreadsheets, and presentations summarization, extraction, and creation; Google Search and Microsoft Bing web search; OpenAI, Anthropic, and Hugging Face language models; iFixit repair guides and wikis search and summarization; MapReduce for question answering, and more.

## Design Principles 
To clarify how LangChain simplifies the development process, let's examine the key components of the framework and apply them to the development of a virtual assistant for students. The flow of the virtual assistant is simple - it asks the student what course assignment he wants to get help on and then looks for existing assignments in the DB and provides a step-by-step explanation of the solution. If the assignment doesn't exist in the internal DB, Virtual Assistant will use
